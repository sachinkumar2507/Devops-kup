### Ques : What is squashfs file system?
Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux. It uses zlib compression to compress both files, inodes and directories. Inodes in the system are very small and all blocks are packed to minimize data overhead. Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of 64K.

### Ques : What are /dev/loop and /dev/tty ?

> The /dev/loop devices treat files with a filesystem image as if they were block devices. 

The loop devices are snaps because snap packages are created that way.
These files were containing a filesystem that is mounted to the location. It is an approach that developers use to pack an entire package in a single file, but the operating system access all the files. The approach used here is therefore known as loop mounts.

/dev/tty is a special file, representing the terminal for the current process.

> `/dev/tty` stands for the controlling terminal (if any) for the current process. To find out which tty's are attached to which processes use the `ps -a` command at the shell prompt (command line). Look at the "tty" column.

### Ques : What are Linux Signals?
A signal is an event generated by the UNIX and Linux systems in response to some condition. Upon receipt of a signal, a process may take action.
A signal is just like an interrupt; when it is generated at the user level, a call is made to the kernel of the OS, which then acts accordingly.
There are two types of signals:
Maskable: signals which can be changed or ignored by the user. 

```
e.g. Ctrl+C.
```

Non-maskable: signals which cannot be changed or ignored by the user. These typically occur when the user is signaled for non-recoverable hardware errors. 

```
Ctrl+Z
```

### Ques : Purpose of hidden files.
To prevent system files or applications files for being changes accidently. These files might contain sensitive config or data and you don't want new user or any user to mess up accidently.
We can also change permission to prevent from accidental changes.

### Ques : How ext4 fs is faster ?
Ext4 introduces a lot of improvements in the ways storage blocks are allocated before writing them to disk, which can significantly increase both read and write performance.


### Ques : What is swap & swap memory?
Swap space is parallel space within the RAM. When there is no enough RAM space available, linux kernel takes some of the information from RAM and writes it to the swap space on the hard drive. This process is swapping process.This way, your linux system can release some RAM space and doesn't crash due to lack of memory.

Two Swap options we can use in linux


| Swap Partion                                              | Swap File                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Part of your hard drive                                   | A file alternate to partition                            |
| Once configured, it is not easy to change                 | You can modify the size of the swap file anytime, easily |
| Created at the time of installing your Linux distribution | Can be created after the installation.                   |

### Ques : how to mount a file system?
To mount a file system on device we use mount commands.

For example:

> mount [OPTION...] DEVICE_NAME DIRECTORY
>

```
sudo mount /dev/sda /media/knoldus/sachin
```

Usually when mounting a device it auto-detect common file system such as ext4 or xfs. To specify file system type use -t option

```
sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/sda /media/knoldus/Sachin
```

### Ques : ZFS use case.

**ZFS(Zettabyte file system)** File system created by sun microsystems. Zfs use virtual storage pools known as storage pools that can deal with storage & management of large amounts of data. It is designed to ensure that no data cannot be lost due to physical errors or misprocessing by hardware or OS.

Ques : How to check which process running on which port?

### Using lsof command

```
lsof -i -P -n | grep -i "listen"
```

where,

- `-i` : Look for listing ports
- `-P` : Inhibits the conversion of port numbers to port names for network files.
- `-n` : Do not use DNS name

### Using netstat command

```
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN
```

where,

- `-t` : All TCP ports
- `-u` : All UDP ports
- `-l` : display listening server
- `-p` : show PID & name
- `-n` : Don't resolves names & show ip `localhost` -> `127.0.0.1`

### Ques : what is unix time sharing?

This namespace is unfortunately named by today's standards. It dates back to the early days of Unix and has to do with how information was stored for a specific system call. Today, this detail is largely lost to history and what you really need to know is that the UTS namespace allows for the segregation of hostnames. Often hostnames are simply a convenience.

### Ques : what are control groups?

Cgroups are, therefore, a facility built into the kernel that allow the administrator to set resource utilization limits on any process on the system. In general, cgroups control:

- The number of CPU shares per process.
- The limits on memory per process.
- Block Device I/O per process.
- Which network packets are identified as the same type so that another application can enforce network traffic rules.

**Cgroups have four main features**

1. Resource Limiting
2. Priotizing
3. Accounting
4. Process control

### Ques : difference between bin & usr/bin ?

Both are same directories. but the difference is the /usr/bin is access the super user only.

```
/bin` is symbolic link to `/usr/bin
```

### Ques : Examples of awk, grep and sed

1. [awk](https://github.com/Rahul-Soni28/Linux-kup-notes/blob/master/Day-2/sed-grep-awk.md#awk)
2. sed
3. grep

###### awk

Let's create a file first

```
cat > test.txt
```

Add data in this `test.txt`

```
ajay manager account 45000
sunil clerk account 25000
varun manager sales 50000
amit manager account 47000
tarun peon sales 15000
deepak clerk sales 23000
sunil peon sales 13000
satvik director purchase 80000 
```

- To print lines having `account` word

```
awk '/account/{print $0}' test.txt
```

output will look like

```
ajay manager account 45000
sunil clerk account 25000
amit manager account 47000
```

------

- To print 2nd field of file

```
awk '{print $2}' test.txt
```

Output Will look like:

```
manager
clerk
manager
manager
peon
clerk
peon
director
```
